Welcome to the GANsNotGains' team project page. The team consists of Ehsan Asdar (easdar3), Ashwini Iyer (aiyer65), Matthew Kaufer (mkaufer3), Nidhi Palwayi (spalwayi3), and Kexin Zhang (kzhang323).

At a high level, our project goal is to generate artwork using GANs – generative, adversarial networks.
